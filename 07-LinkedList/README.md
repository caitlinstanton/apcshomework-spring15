<h1>Linked Lists</h1>
- Node: contains data and information on how to get to next node
- Data in each node is localized, so that each node only knows how to get to the next node and has no idea that there are more nodes
- Kind of like a circular list:
  - Alice then Joseph then Michael then David then Mariya then Dillon then Alice then Joseph then Michael then David then Mariya then Dillon then Alice...
  - Like people taking turns in a game
