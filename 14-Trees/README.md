- Graph: collection of nodes (vertices) and edges
	- Node: holds data
	- Edge: connects nodes
	- Connected components: nodes conencted by an edge
	- Graphs are composed of connected and disconnected components
- Cycle: going from one node all the way back to itself
- Height: length of longest root and leaf path

<h2>Types of Graphs</h2>
- Weighted graph: graph whose edges have been measured
- Directed graph: graph where the edges can only go in a specific direction
- Weighted directed graph: weighted graph whose edges have direction
- Trees: an acyclic graph with one node designated as the root
	- <h4> OR </h4>
	- either empty or has one of more nodes; each node can have one or more children, and one node is designated as the root
	- drawn from top down, or from the side across (stemming from the root node)
- Binary tree: each leaf has one or two children

<h2>Nodes</h2>
- Leaf: node without children
- Root
- Child
- Parent
- Siblings
- Ancestors: any node on the path from n to the root
- Descendants: children, their children, etc.
